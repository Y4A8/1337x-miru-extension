**Known Limitations:**

*   Miru currently doesn't provide an API to directly open magnet links in torrent clients.
*   Custom UI elements for filtering and sorting are not yet implemented (pending further research on Miru's capabilities).

**Future Plans:**

*   Explore and implement custom UI elements for filtering and sorting if Miru's API allows it.
*   Investigate potential integration with subtitle providers.
*   Enhance background updates with more detailed notifications.

**Special Thanks:**

*   To the developers of Miru for creating such a versatile application.
*   To the AI assistant for its valuable contributions to this project.

**Enjoy exploring the world of torrents with this Miru extension!**
